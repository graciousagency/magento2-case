## The Case
Using the API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/

We want to see the following:
- Import characters from the API into a custom table
- Use a Magento command to run the import
- An admin grid showing the characters
- A form to edit a character
- Once a character has been edited by hand it should not be overwritten by the import anymore
- Add an option in adminhtml to disable/enable the import

Make sure it is something you're proud of and shows us your knowledge and abilities!

## Bonus points
Want to impress us a bit more? Here are some tips to do so
- Make it (the code) look pretty
- Add support for REST and/or GraphQL
- Add tests
- Come up with a solution for relational data from the API
- Use an EAV entity instead of a single table
- Add cache
- Add indexes
